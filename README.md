Cube Trainer Version A1.0


Welcome to Cube Trainer! This program is still in its early development cycle.

Right now, the OLL trainer is the only thing that is fully fuctional. OLL trainer allows you to select which algs you wish to focus on and shows you the alg to solve it. The selected algs will display one at a time in a random order.


Known Issues:

Color mismatch on some of the existing algs

Clicking "Next" doesn't show a new alg

  -This is due to the randomization structure and will be fixed in upcoming releases
  
Clicking "Stop" reopens the OLL Trainer window

  -This button is intended to "reset" the form and will be modified in future versions to be smoother



Future Major Update Cycle :

Implement PLL trainer

Implement ability to edit Algs based on preference

Overall update to enhance stability, performance, and visuals to each of the modules

Please report any other issues to me ASAP

And as always, if you have any questions or suggestions, please message me :)
